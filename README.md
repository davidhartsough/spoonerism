# Spoonerizer

This is just a lil' web app that converts two words into a **spoonerism** (and tries something fun with words beginning with vowels).

A [spoonerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism) is an error in speech in which corresponding consonants (or vowels) are switched between two words.

TODO:

- Change things up based on capitalization.
